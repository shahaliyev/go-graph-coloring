# The “graph” presented above has 5 vertices: “1”, “2”, “3”, “18” and “19”, and 4 edges.
# Only the edges are provided in terms of first vertex and second vertex
# Edges are undirected: 1 is adjacent to 3, and 3 is adjacent to 1.
# In some graphs, the edge may be included twice (1,3) as well as (3,1) – just ignore the second one.
